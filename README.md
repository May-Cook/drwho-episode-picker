# drwho-episode-picker
A GitHub pages website that randomly chooses episodes of [Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)

It was created to replace [this project](https://github.com/May-Cook/python-drwho-episode-picker) as it was becoming difficult to use and maintain in python

The site can be found [Here](https://may-cook.github.io/drwho-episode-picker/)

## My motivations
This project and the one above were created because I often struggle to select what episode of [Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who) to rewatch because I find there are too many choices, and I wanted to create a program to create random suggestions. I am creating this for my own benefit but you are welcome to use it if you find it helpful.

## Ideas I want to implement
* Quotes from each or at least some episodes
* Selecting by series/doctor, perhaps by other factors
* A Link to my GitHub
* Perhaps some thumbnails from the episode
* Storing Settings in Cookies
