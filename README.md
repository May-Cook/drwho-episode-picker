# drwho-episode-picker
A GitHub pages website that randomly chooses episodes of [Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)

Is was created to replace [this project](https://github.com/May-Cook/python-drwho-episode-picker) as it was becoming difficalt to use and maintain in python

## My motivations
This project and the one above were created because I often struggle to select what episode of [Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who) to rewatch becauase I find there are two many choices, and I wanted to create a program to create random suggestions. I am creating this for my own benefit but you are welcome to use it if you find it helpful.
